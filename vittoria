<h2>Instructions:</h2>
 <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease and flour a 22cm (9-inch) round cake pan, or line it with parchment paper.<br/></li>
 <li>Melt the chocolate and butter. Place the chopped chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl and melt them together over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) or in the microwave, stirring every 20 seconds until smooth. Let it cool slightly.<br/></li>
 <li>Whisk the ricotta and sugar. In a large bowl, whisk together the ricotta cheese and sugar until smooth and creamy.<br/></li>
 <li>Add eggs and vanilla. Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each one is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract.<br/></li>
 <li>Add the melted chocolate and butter. Slowly pour the melted chocolate and butter mixture into the ricotta mixture, stirring well to combine.<br/></li>
 <li>Mix dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt.<br/></li>
 <li>Combine wet and dry ingredients. Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until just combined. The batter will be thick but smooth.<br/></li>
 <li>Bake the cake. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The cake should feel firm but springy to the touch.<br/></li>
 <li>Cool and serve. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.<br/></li>
 <li>Dust with powdered sugar. Once the cake is completely cool, dust the top with powdered sugar for an elegant finish.<br/></li>
