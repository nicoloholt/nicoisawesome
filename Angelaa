  <h2>Instructions:

</h2>
  <p>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

Mix the wet ingredients: In a large bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

Combine the dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.

Combine wet and dry ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.

Add the chocolate chips: Stir in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

Shape the cookies: Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are still soft.

Cool: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.

Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!</p>
